# Version 1.0

We want a Mars globe in the browser. Similar to this [Nasa Mars map](https://trek.nasa.gov/mars/#).

webGL / three.js / [Cesium](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium) seem to be the best stack.

Website visitors should be able to

- spin the planet.
- zoom in and out,

When zooming in, load different levels of high res images. For which can use the [Nasa API](https://api.nasa.gov/?search=mars).

# Version 2.0

When we solved the problems above, we want to build new features:

- 3D Tiles: Use elevation data to show the depth of terrain. Like in ([this demo](https://60411c631a034500071134b2--compassionate-hodgkin-5fe53e.netlify.app/)), built in the `threejs` branch (using textures/bump.jpg layer)
- Show geodata like landing sites, from a [a json file like this](mars_landings.geojson).
- Let user choose between different layers / WMTS map source. Like in [this example](https://source.opennews.org/articles/how-we-made-rewind-red-planet), where users can choose between a normal Mars map today, and one with water on the lower surface of Mars.
- Click one section - like a square of 100 kilometers - to show a black square line around that same area. Similar to this:
